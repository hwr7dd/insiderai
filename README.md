Text analysis in R featuring Elon Musk tweets.

In quantitative analysis most current models rely on acute changes in intra-day stock price as a method for predicting stock price. Even the best models are rarely able to obtain above a 50% success rate. In this project we are going to try to determine if there is a way to predict Tesla stock price based on Elon Musk's tweets. Here is an illustration of the flow of data through the program:

The first task is to fetch the tweets we want to analyze. For the training of the model we will focus on Elon Musk. 

We will evaluate the past 20 tweets before Q1 2018 Quarterly Earnings report for each CEO to see if there are any correlations between the too.
